This repository contains the configurations of my machines using NixOS. 

### *What is NixOS ?*

NixOS is a linux distribution based on the Nix package manager. It allows fully reproducible builds and a declarative configuration style, using a functionnal langage called Nix (yes, it is the same name as the package manager and the OS).

Machines configurations are located in the machines folder, and are using all the custom modules defined in this project.

#### Modules

This configuration defines a number of custom NixOS and home-manager modules. They are respectively defined in the modules and home-manager-modules folders.

#### Secrets

Secrets are stored in the secrets folder. They are uncrypted upon system activation using the host ssh key. Secrets are managed using agenix.

### Inspirations 

This project is freely inspired by some really cool projects, including MayNiklas/nixos, pinox/nixos and ncfavier/config.
