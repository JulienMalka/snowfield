# My NixOS Configurations ‚ùÑ

This repository contains the configurations of my machines using NixOS. 

### *What is NixOS ?*

NixOS is a linux distribution based on the Nix package manager. It allows fully reproducible builds and a declarative configuration style, using a functionnal langage called Nix (yes, it is the same name as the package manager and the OS).

### *What is a flake ?*

This whole repository is a flake. It is an experimental feature of Nix.
